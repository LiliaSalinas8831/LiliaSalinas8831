## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my repository! This project showcases my work as a backend developer building full-featured web applications using Ruby on Rails. It emphasizes clean, maintainable code with a focus on RESTful API design, robust database management, and efficient background job processing to support scalable and responsive applications.

At the heart of this project is a well-structured RESTful API that adheres to standard conventions for resourceful routing, versioning, and JSON serialization. Iâ€™ve implemented controller logic with strong parameters, pagination, and error handling to ensure a consistent and predictable interface for frontend or third-party consumers. Authentication and authorization are handled securely, using JWTs or token-based systems depending on the projectâ€™s needs.

The backend is powered by Active Record and a thoughtfully designed relational database schema. Migrations, validations, and associations are used to enforce data integrity and business logic at the model layer. I've also incorporated techniques like eager loading and indexing to improve database performance and minimize N+1 query issues.

To enhance responsiveness and offload time-consuming processes, the project uses background jobs with tools like Sidekiq or Active Job. These are used for tasks such as email notifications, data processing, and external API interactions, all monitored through retry mechanisms and job queues for reliability.

This repository serves as a practical guide for developers looking to build scalable Rails backends with a clean architecture and production-ready features. Whether you're integrating it with a frontend app, building an API-first product, or exploring Rails as a backend framework, feel free to explore the code, open issues, or contribute.
